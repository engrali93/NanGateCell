# NanGateCell
Application designed to simulate the timing of the circuits. The program is based on NanGateCell 14nm technology.

Using Sdf and VHDL file as an input to simulate the logic output of VHDL and also timing simulation of the VHDL

Parameter taken into considerations are:
1) Faults.
2) Default Delay.
3) Rise Time.
4) Fall TIme.



Program can support upto 16-bit for timing simulation and 32-bit for logic output.
